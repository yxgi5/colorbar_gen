@W: MT531 :"/home/andy/Downloads/tmp/colorbar_gen/colorbar/reveal_workspace/tmpreveal/top_rvl.v":1360:12:1360:15|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 24 sequential elements including hdmi_i2c_top_inst.hdmi_i2c_ctrl_inst.addr_dev[6].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/andy/Downloads/tmp/colorbar_gen/colorbar/reveal_workspace/tmpreveal/top_rvl.v":1158:4:1158:9|Found inferred clock pll_sensor_clk_uniq_1|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 318 sequential elements including u_colorbar_gen.linecnt[10:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/andy/Downloads/tmp/colorbar_gen/colorbar/reveal_workspace/tmpreveal/top_rvl.v":1332:4:1332:9|Found inferred clock top|clk_in which controls 61 sequential elements including hdmi_i2c_top_inst.hdmi_i2c_ctrl_inst.step_cnt[11:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
